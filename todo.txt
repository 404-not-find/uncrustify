This is a list of TODO items:

Most important features (in order):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Indenting lines correctly
   + continuing on parens, assignment ops, and strings

 - Add/remove spaces around operators

 - aligning
   + struct/union definitions
       struct foo_t {
          const char *name;
	  uint32_t   age;
       };

   + static struct variable definitions
       struct foo_t bar = {
          .name = "bar",
	  .age  = 21
       };
       struct foo_t bars[] = {
          [0] = { .name = "bar",
	          .age  = 21 },
          [1] = { .name = "barley",
	          .age  = 55 },
       };

   + enum definition
       enum fruits {
          apple     = 1,
	  orange    = 2,
	  pineapple = 4,
       };

   + variable definitions
      int           a;
      unsigned char b;

   + assignments
      a.latitude  = 1;
      a.longitude = 2;
      a.altitude  = 3;

   + trailing comments
      int a;  // this is a variable that has
              // a multi-line C++ comment

 - adding and removing parens around return expressions (safe code change)
   + add in all cases
   + remove in all cases
   + remove for simple cases

 - adding braces to do the fully braced format (dangerous code change)

 - removing braces to do the un-braced format (dangerous code change)


Here's the stuff that needs doing that I consider important:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Keep track of if a tab was right before the token so that it can be outputted
   without changing tabs to spaces

1. Fix the #define aligning crap. it's broken.
   It's adding 4 spaces all the time and the align threshold hasn't been
   implemented.  In short, it sucks.

2. Finish the comment indenting and aligning so it isn't such a POS.

3. Preprocessor crap

 * indent levels for if/else/endif preprocessors

 * Ignore #define body by default

 * add option to space and/or line break, etc #define bodies

 * indent preprocessor bodies

4. General aligning

   - thresholds!  I hate seeing silly alignments:

   This:
{
   char c                = 0;
   int  really_long_name = 1;
}

   Should be this, assuming a sane align threshold, like 3 or so.
{
   char c = 0;
   int  really_long_name = 1;
}


5. Splitting lines

   - Figure out some sort of sane approach (ie, look at the indent source)

   - Not sure I want to go there...


For when I really get bored:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Look into trying out D support.  Shouldn't be too hard.



For when I get bored of all my games and have a really long vacation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Look into C++ support
   + templates scare me
     - need to figure out how to (reliably) tell the difference between
       a template variable and a useless comparison

   + may be impossible to do right without some type-awareness

Test Plan

============================================================================
============================================================================

Create ".test" files that contain test entries as follows:
[test name]
config	configfile.cfg
input	sourcefile.c
output	outputfile.c

Of maybe just put it all on one line (easier to parse?)
test name : configfile.cfg sourcefile.c outputfile.c

Basically, the test would be to run uncrustify with these options:
$ uncrustify -c configfile.cfg -f sourcefile.c > temp.c

If the temp.c and outputfile.c differ, the test failed.

The test driver would be a simple python script or something.

Maybe it would create a nice list of all the test that failed.


The types of test could be created:
 - tests for stuff that DOES work now, to detect regressions
 - tests for future features, to know when I finally get it right




============================================================================
============================================================================

Configuration files

============================================================================
============================================================================

Create working config files for these categories:

 - K&R
 - GNU
 - Linux kernel
 - Ben's favorite (used in uncrustify)
 - xsupplicant (weird almost-GNU style)

That should be enough examples.

I plan to add any style that people want.
I mean, throwing in another config file won't hurt anything...

Add some smarts to uncrustify so that it scans for config files as follows:
 - check in the current folder (exact name only)
 - check in ~/.uncrustify
 - check in /etc/uncrustify

If the -c option doesn't end in a '.cfg' it'll try first without and then with the .cfg
If the config contains a path component, then only check that path.
