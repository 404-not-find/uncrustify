BUGS:

If something goes terribly wrong, uncrustify will not output anything to stdout.
This could cause some problems if you automate with a script.
Don't blindly copy the 'new' file over the old file.

'align_with_tabs' doesn't work quite right, yet.
Don't use it.

   List of minor formatting bugs
----------------====----------------

* Assignments in variable definitions should not be aligned with
  assignments in non-variable defs.  Or at least there should be
  an option to determine whether to do it or not.

        uint h = typeid(char[]).getHash(&x);
        h     += ~(h << 9);
        h     ^= (h >>> 14);

* When NOT adding the '*' in comments, we are adding spaces/tabs to blank
  lines.  Also, comments are being indented incorrectly:

   /***********************************

   A multi-line comment that should not have the closing line indented

   ***********************************/

* In D, C#, and maybe Java, an empty [] should be counted as a type.
  Failure to do so prevents the following from properly aligning:

        int       nextTableIndex;
        HashEntry[] currentTable;
        HashEntry nextEntry;

  should be:

        int       nextTableIndex;
        HashEntry[] currentTable;
        HashEntry nextEntry;
